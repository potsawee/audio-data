it has around 11 hours

The corpus was collected in the Automatic Speech Recognition class offered at Chulalongkorn University as a homework assignment. The corpus comprises of the recordings from the Spring 2017-2023 course offerings. The students were asked to form a group of up to six people. Each group were asked to come up with an example smart home application. Each group will record the same set of sentences that they came up with. More specifically, the students were instructed to:

Collect 101 utterances per person (same sentences for each group)
The first utterance is "Gowajee". This is designated as the wakeword.
The second utterance must start with "Gowajee" with an accompanying command
16k Hz, 16 bit depth, mono
In the first two years (2017-2018) the students were encouraged to record with the provided uni-directional microphones. However, this is not enforced. For the latter years, the students were encouraged to record using the hardware they wish to demo on.
They are no other specifications about the recording environment
